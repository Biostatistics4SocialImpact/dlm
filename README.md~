# dlm: Fit distributed lag models in R using the lme4 package
---

The GitHub version of this package is (for now) a pre-release snapshot and is installable, but not guaranteed to work out of the box if downloaded on any given day. The goal is to have the package fully operational and on CRAN by January 2018.

Thanks!
